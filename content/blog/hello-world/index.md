This is my first post on my new fake blog! How exciting!

I'm sure I'll write a lot more interesting things in the future.

Oh, and here's a great quote from this Wikipedia on
[salted duck eggs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salted_duck_egg).

```jsx{6}

  console.log("Whoopeee")
  console.log(`Hey there`)

    const { location, title, children } = this.props
    const rootPath = `${__PATH_PREFIX__}/`
    let header

    if (location.pathname === rootPath) {
      header = (
        <h1
          style={{
            ...scale(1),

> A salted duck egg is a Chinese preserved food product made by soaking duck
> eggs in brine, or packing each egg in damp, salted charcoal. In Asian

> charcoal paste. The eggs may also be sold with the salted paste removed,
> wrapped in plastic, and vacuum packed. From the salt curing process, the
> salted duck eggs have a briny aroma, a gelatin-like egg white and a
> firm-textured, round yolk that is bright orange-red in color.
